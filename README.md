# Differential Amplifer

This circuit is designed to be a single supply differential amplifier module which can be used in building Manhattan style prototypes.

Use whatever op-amp has a compatible pinout (there are dozens) and pick your gain. All of the passives are laid out as 0805 components to make soldering easier.

Enjoy!
